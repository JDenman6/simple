## Hello... World!
### This is just a quick profile page project.

Getting myself back on to practical projects after a year or so of more
academic learning about Ruby and programming in general.

* [x] We're starting with Ruby v 2.3.1 on  Rails 5.0.2
* The first goal will be to recreate the portfolio page here:
  - http://codepen.io/JDenman6/pen/EKLGZJ
  - [x] appearance
  - [ ] working links
* The next step will be to get the feedback form working
* Then I'll add more projects and accolades:
  - HackerRank progress
  - Freecodecamp certification
  - Coder Dojo volunteering
  - Salesforce admin experience
  - etc. etc. etc.
* Then I want to get the sliding backdrop effect working.
