## Hello... World!
### This is just a quick profile page project.

Getting myself back on to practical projects after a year or so of more
academic learning about Ruby and programming in general.

* [x] We're starting with Ruby v 2.3.1 on  Rails 5.0.2
* [x] The first goal will be to recreate the portfolio page here:
  - http://codepen.io/JDenman6/pen/EKLGZJ
  - [x] appearance
  - [x] working links
* [ ] The next step will be to get the feedback form working
  - [x] working feedback form on main page
  - [ ] style feedback form to fit my style.
* [ ] Then I'll add more projects and accolades:
  - [x] Qubed space prototype
  - [ ] HackerRank progress
  - [ ] Freecodecamp certification
  - [ ] Coder Dojo volunteering
  - [ ] Salesforce admin experience
  - [ ] etc. etc. etc.
* [ ] Then I want to get the sliding backdrop effect working.
